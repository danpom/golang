# Golang
Home to golang code, from exercises to personal projects

### Table of Contents
1. [Exercise Tracker](https://github.com/danpom/golang/tree/main/exercise-tracker)
	
	Application to log a track exercises/workouts. Built as a CRUD demo. Golang body interacting with a MySQL DB. 
	Currently have functions to add exercises and workouts. I've hardcoded some values to test insertion and retrieval. Will likely work on a building a GUI next

2. [Hangman](https://github.com/danpom/golang/tree/main/hangman)
	
	Hangman game that randomly selects a movie from IMDBâ€™s top 250 list for the user to guess

3. [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/danpom/golang/tree/main/tic-tac-toe)

	Personal project to create a command line game of Tic Tac Toe from scratch.
	Started this after starting the chess project and realising even the simplist of chess games would be a larger scope than I imagined.
	Plan to use this as a stepping stone to learn some concepts and return to the chess project as I learn

4. [exercism](https://github.com/danpom/golang/tree/main/exercism)

	Solutions to [exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises) exercises (usernam: @danpom)

5. [udemy-learn-go](https://github.com/danpom/golang/tree/main/udemy-learn-go)

	Solutions to the end of section exercises in Todd McLeod's Udemy course ["Learn How To Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language"](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/). The course calls these "ninja levels"
	
6. [Tutorials](https://github.com/danpom/golang/tree/main/tutorials)
	
	These are tutorials I have followed to broaden my understanding of Golang and familiarise myself with key concepts

7. [leetcode](https://github.com/danpom/golang/tree/main/leetcode)

	Solutions to leetcode exercises. Not many of these completed so far as I decided to progress with exercism instead

6. [Chess](https://github.com/danpom/golang/tree/main/chess)

	Personal project to create the game of chess from scratch. Hoping to eventually create some bots that at the very least make legal moves
