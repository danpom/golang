Home to golang code, from exercises to personal projects

### Table of Contents
1. [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/danpom/golang/tree/main/tic-tac-toe)

	Personal project to create a command line game of Tic Tac Toe from scratch.
	Started this after starting the chess project and realising even the simplist of chess games would be a larger scope than I imagined.
	Plan to use this as a stepping stone to learn some concepts and return to the chess project as I learn

2. [Chess](https://github.com/danpom/golang/tree/main/chess)

	Personal project to create the game of chess from scratch. Hoping to eventually create some bots that at the very least make legal moves

	Solutions to [exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/go/exercises) exercises (usernam: @danpom)

4. [udemy-learn-go](https://github.com/danpom/golang/tree/main/udemy-learn-go)

	Solutions to the end of section exercises in Todd McLeod's Udemy course ["Learn How To Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language"](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/). The course calls these "ninja levels"

5. [leetcode](https://github.com/danpom/golang/tree/main/leetcode)

	Solutions to leetcode exercises. Not many of these completed so far as I decided to progress with exercism instead
